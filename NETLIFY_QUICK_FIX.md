# 🚨 Quick Fix for Netlify Build Error

## The Problem:
Netlify can't find your `package.json` because the build settings are incorrect.

---

## ✅ Fix in 2 Minutes:

### Step 1: Go to Netlify Settings

1. **Visit:** https://app.netlify.com
2. **Click:** Your site (`projectplannerweb`)
3. **Click:** **"Site settings"** (top right)
4. **Click:** **"Build & deploy"** (left sidebar)
5. **Click:** **"Edit settings"** (under "Build settings")

### Step 2: Update These Settings

**Clear/Update these fields:**

1. **Base directory:** 
   - Leave **EMPTY** (or type `/` if it's not empty)
   - This tells Netlify the app is in the repo root

2. **Build command:**
   - Should be: `npm run build`
   - If it's different, change it to this

3. **Publish directory:**
   - **IMPORTANT:** Leave this **EMPTY** or delete any value
   - The Next.js plugin handles this automatically
   - Having a value here breaks the build!

4. **Node version:**
   - Should be: `18` (or leave default)

### Step 3: Save and Redeploy

1. **Click:** **"Save"** (bottom of page)
2. **Go to:** **"Deploys"** tab
3. **Click:** **"Trigger deploy"** → **"Clear cache and deploy site"**
4. **Wait:** 2-5 minutes for build

## ✅ What Should Happen:

After fixing, the build should:
- ✅ Find `package.json`
- ✅ Run `npm install`
- ✅ Run `npm run build`
- ✅ Deploy successfully

---

## 🔍 If Still Failing:

**Check the build logs and look for:**
- Does it find `package.json`? (Should say "Installing dependencies")
- Any error messages about missing files?
- Node version issues?

**Share the error message and I'll help fix it!**

**The key fix: Make sure "Publish directory" is EMPTY!** 🎯
